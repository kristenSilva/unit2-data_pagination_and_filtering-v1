Data Pagination and Filtering

This project uses a common web development technique `pagination` to enhance the usability of a web page. This app contains information for 42 mock students, including name, email, and picture. Nine students are displayed per page. Pagination buttons are included which a user can click to display different pages of students. A search bar is dynamically created that filters student data - pagination buttons update according to search results.
